Child theme for [Shapla](https://wordpress.org/themes/shapla/)

To avoid loading style.css twice when using child theme Shapla already load its child theme style.css file when its child theme is active.
So you do not need to write function to load your style.css file. Just start writing your own css at style.css file.

Write your own custom function or overwrite existing parent theme functions at functions.php.

Thank you for using [Shapla WordPress Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/shapla/).
